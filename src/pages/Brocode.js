 Following the life experiences that I have gone through, my passion is directed towards serving the young generation through developing and implementing solutions to life challenges. <p></p>
 Life is not what we think it is at a younger age and some humans are not whom we think they are. Having gone through all the psychological tests of life and relating it to what many other young men and women go through, I involve myself in stress relieving and socializing moments, business oriented thinking, distinguishing between leadership & service versus politics and lastly realising personal strengths and weaknesses.<p></p>
 Part of my pride is sharing with you the team of colleagues who stood by my side, encouraged me, shared happy moments with me and above all kept intouch with me for over years. Get to know them below.<p></p>

 Opio Isaac (Kayas) is a man of his own. He has alot of manly qualities and one that I’ve noticed over the years is his huge ego that makes him want most of the things or if not everything be done his way. 
He is very good at explaining in detail. Opio Isaac loves seeing people happy, he is a very generous person. <p></p>

 <div>
 A brother from another mother is Opio Isaac (Kayas) to me.
How different family ties get to relate and form a bond is the mysteriousness of life and I guess the magic behind the glory of God.
<p></p>Isaac (Kayas) is an inventor and a highly creative man and very trustworthy!
One thing he keeps on teaching indirectly is how to be close to perfectionism that I never see in myself.
Love you brother!<p></p>

 Opio Isaac (Kayas) is a smart, bright, quick learner and above all, a sought-after wiseacre. Few people know the true meaning of the nickname 'Kayas' which has become well-known and a household brand. <p></p>I really appreciate and acknowledge all of your efforts on my behalf when we first met nine years ago. If you know him, you'll understand why I refer to him as an 'all-the rounder' — it's most accurate description. Many blessings and success.<p></p>

 Opio Isaac (Kayas)  has always thought outside the box and he is a man of intelligence and integrity.<p></p>He is always available to friends in each and every hardship and has always wanted the best for us ever since we were in high school. I always pray God grants him his needs and wants.<p></p>

 Despite the fact that my brothers made it public about how best they could describe me, I too take the honour to share how best I know each one of them.<p></p>
 
 Charles (Bambino) is one who is very flexible in what ever situation of life. He easily adapts to all kinds of moments be it sorrowful, hard times or happy times. You may never get to know the best of him if really you don't need to. He is is welcoming to everyone who comes across his gorgious eyes.<p></p>
 
 Alfred (Ovon) is one who drives his life to the best of his thoughts. He is very apologetic and has no shame in saying that he is very sorry. He is very entertaining and amongst us, he is the one with the most entertaining laughter. His laughter will not only make you laugh but will make you feel like forwarding his contact to a friend you feel needs to laugh as well. <p></p>
 
 Jean (Bhazi) is one person who takes more care about himself. He is welcoming to every one, entertaining in all situations. He loves to archieve the best in what ever he does and always works hard to archieve dreams that make him happy.
 
 <p></p>Davis (Wobu) is a very entertainig one as well and can be funny. He has no shame in anything so long as his body deserves his comfort. He is one who avoids any risky situations just because he may not be in position to handle all of them as the saying goes; 'prevention is better than cure' and also 'cowards live longer'. He is open only to those who are open to him.
